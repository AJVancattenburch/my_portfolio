  <h1>Welcome to my portfolio!</h1>

  <hr />

  <p style="font-size: 16px;">
    This is my personal portfolio in which I have showcased all my most recent projects, work experience, and relevant education / earned certifications, contact information, and a little bit about me that makes me unique in my creative problem solving and technical abilities.
  </P>
  <p style="font-size: 16px;">
    I am also creating this portfolio as a template for others to use for their own professional portfolio with a consistent and clean design that is easy to navigate and understand. As I continue to grow and develop my this project, I will be adding more features and functionality to make it even more user-friendly and customizable for others to use.
  </p>


  <div style="background: linear-gradient(-90deg, #3e3164 0%, #231d2e99 100%); padding: 15px; margin-block: 25px;">
    <h1>How to Render your Personalized Content</h1>
    <p style="font-size: 16px;">
      Each javascript file located in the <span style="background: linear-gradient(to top, #FFFF00, #FFF); -webkit-background-clip: text;-webkit-text-fill-color: transparent;"><b>/src/constants</b></span> folder represents the different sections of the portfolio page (see below image):
    </p>
    <img src="./src/assets/img/README_images/constants-folder-files-location.png" class="img-fluid" width="200" style="padding-top: 5px; padding-bottom: 25px;" />
    <p style="font-size: 16px;">
      By simply changing the values in the above referenced files located in the <span style="background: linear-gradient(to top, #FFFF00, #FFF); -webkit-background-clip: text;-webkit-text-fill-color: transparent;"><b>/src/constants</b></span> folder, you can easily customize this portfolio to fit your own personal brand.
    </p>

  <div style="background: linear-gradient(-90deg, #7d003c 0%, #231d2e99 100%); padding: 15px">
    <h1>How to Render your Personalized Styles / Themes</h1>
    <p style="font-size: 16px;">
      I have also included a <span style="background: linear-gradient(to top, #00CEA8, #FFF); -webkit-background-clip: text;-webkit-text-fill-color: transparent;"><b>_root.scss</b></span> file in the <span style="background: linear-gradient(to top, #00CEA8, #FFF); -webkit-background-clip: text;-webkit-text-fill-color: transparent;"><b>/src/assets/scss</b></span> folder that allows you to easily change the color scheme of the entire portfolio with just a few lines of code. Visual reference of file location for themes and styles provided below:
    </p>
    <img src="./src/assets/img/README_images/styles-and-themes-file-location.png" class="img-fluid" width="200" style="padding-top: 5px; padding-bottom: 25px;" />
    <p style="font-size: 16px;">
      Read the relevant comments to see what each CSS variable will style on the page. I will be adding these necessary comments above specific variable names so that you can change the page background, font color, and gradient color themes on the fly!
    </p>
  </div>

  <p style="font-size: 16px; padding: 25px 15px;">
    As this project nears completion, I will be adding more detailed instructions on how to use this template for your own portfolio, so stay tuned for more updates!
