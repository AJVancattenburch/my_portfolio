Welcome to my portfolio!
===================

This is my personal portfolio in which I have showcased all my most recent projects, work experience, and relevant education / earned certifications, contact information, and a little bit about me that makes me unique in my creative problem solving and technical abilities.

I am also creating this portfolio as a template for others to use for their own professional portfolio with a consistent and clean design that is easy to navigate and understand. As I continue to grow and develop my this project, I will be adding more features and functionality to make it even more user-friendly and customizable for others to use.

Each javascript file located in the `src/constants` folder represents the different sections of the portfolio page (see below image):



By simply changing the values in each content file located in the `src/constants` folder, you can easily customize this portfolio to fit your own personal brand and style. I have also included a `_root.scss` file in the `/src/assets/scss` folder that allows you to easily change the color scheme of the entire portfolio with just a few lines of code.

As this project nears completion, I will be adding more detailed instructions on how to use this template for your own portfolio, so stay tuned for more updates!
